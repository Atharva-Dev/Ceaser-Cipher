Caesar Cipher cryptography is one of the easiest cryptography

**In encryption:**
            Key is added to charater (if it is alphabet)

**In decryption:**
            Key is subtracted from character (if it is alphabet)
            

Process happens in circular manner 
eg. If key is 4 and  text contains z, that z will convert into c 
( a, b, ... y, z, a, ..)
